name: Scheduled Job Failure Monitor

# This workflow monitors scheduled jobs and creates issues when they fail.
# NOTE: This is kept as a backup for workflows that don't have the post-job step.
# Preferred approach: Add the scheduled-job-issue action as a post-job step
# directly in each scheduled workflow (like ci-feedback for PRs).
